    <h2><Strong>Ingrediants</Strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            3 cups all-purpose flour
        </li>
        <li>

            1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
        </li>
        <li>
            3/4 teaspoon salt
        </li>
        <li>
            3 cups buttermilk
        </li>
        <li>
            1/2 cup milk
        </li>
        <li>
            3 eggs

        <li>
            In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, beat together buttermilk, milk, eggs and melted butter. Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. You can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready!
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork to mix until it's just blended together. The batter will be a little lumpy which is what you want. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour or scoop the batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes; flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
        </li>
    </ol>
